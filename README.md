# Translater
> Desktop application developed with Tkinter and googletrans that allows you to translate text into any language. [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/es/3/library/tkinter.html) is a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces, while [googletrans](https://py-googletrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python library that uses the Google Translate API to translate text, simply enter the text you want to translate and select the target language. The app will take care of the rest.
